DIX-NEZ-LANDE
=============

The game is a turn-by-turn game. Each player
manages a race. The goal of the game is to optimise the
position of the units on the map to get the maximal
number of points at the end of a given number of turns.
To do so, each player starts the game with his units
placed on the same tile of the map. Then, the player
must move his/her units on the map to maximise the
number of points. A unit on a given tile gathers a
given amount of points. This amount of points varies
depending on the type of the tile and the
characteristics of the selected race. By default, a
tile brings 1 point. A unit can attack another unit
(of another player). The goal of attacking units is
to destroy them to limit the amount of points gathered
by players or to occupy a wanted tile. Points are
re-computed at the end of each turn and displayed to
users through the user interface.
